{"name":"Ntu-dsi-dcn","tagline":"An open-source ns-3 simulation framework for datacenter network architectures","body":"### Project overview.\r\nThis project contains an open-source simulation framework based on the ns-3 platform (<http://www.nsnam.org>) for datacenter network architectures. Using the framework, a datacenter network (DCN) topology of interest can be simulated and its corresponding efficiency performance can be easily produced or reproduced.\r\n\r\nThis research initiative is a collaborative effort between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and A*STAR Data Storage Institute, Singapore. It aims to facilitate fair performance reproducibility of DCN architectures and at the same time, eases the tasks of understanding, evaluating and extending these architectures. We welcome and acknowledge contributions from anyone who wishes to improve the NTU-DSI-DCN simulation framework for the benefit of the research community. We can be contacted at ntu.dsi.dcn@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n### Advantages of the framework.\r\n1. It is low cost, without having to invest a lot into hardware to build DCN architectures for simulation purposes\r\n1. It provides transparent performance benchmarks of known DCN architectures\r\n1. It enables unbiased comparative performance simulations of DCN architectures, without the tedium of developing existing DCN simulators from scratch.\r\n1. Researchers can use this framework as the basis to extend or create new DCN architectures for their research work\r\n\r\n### Available datacenter network architectures.\r\n1. Fat-tree architecture\r\n1. BCube architecture\r\n\r\n(More DCN architectures such as VL2, DCell and Portland will be added in the future)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nIf you find our work useful or relevant in some ways, do cite our publications which are listed below:\r\n\r\n1.
