{"name":"Ntu-dsi-dcn","tagline":"An open-source ns-3 simulation framework for datacenter network architectures","body":"### Project overview.\r\nThis project contains an open-source simulation framework based on the ns-3 platform (<http://www.nsnam.org>) for datacenter network architectures. Using the framework, a datacenter network (DCN) topology of interest can be simulated and its corresponding efficiency performance can be easily produced or reproduced.\r\n\r\nThis research initiative is a collaborative effort between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and A*STAR Data Storage Institute, Singapore. It aims to facilitate fair performance reproducibility of DCN architectures and at the same time, eases the tasks of understanding, evaluating and extending these architectures. We welcome and acknowledge contributions from anyone who wishes to improve the NTU-DSI-DCN simulation framework for the benefit of the research community. We can be contacted at ntu.dsi.dcn@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n### Advantages of the framework.\r\n1. It is low cost, without having to invest a lot into hardware to build DCN architectures for simulation purposes\r\n1. It provides transparent performance benchmarks of known DCN architectures\r\n1. It enables unbiased comparative performance simulations of DCN architectures, without the tedium of developing existing DCN simulators from scratch.\r\n1. Researchers can use this framework as the basis to extend or create new DCN architectures for their research work\r\n\r\n## Datacenter network architectures available in the framework.\r\n1. Fat-tree architecture\r\n1. BCube architecture\r\n\r\n(More DCN architectures such as VL2, DCell and Portland will be added in the future)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"UA-42238799-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
